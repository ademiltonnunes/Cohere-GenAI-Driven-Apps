# Cohere - Semantic Search and Rerank Technology Projects

This repository contains two projects demonstrating the use of semantic search and rerank technology to improve information retrieval. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project and references to the detailed documentation.

## Project 1: Semantic Search

This project exemplifies the use of semantic search to generate answers. It includes an example of the process of preparing data, embedding indexes for semantic search, and generating answers.

### Documentation
For a detailed step-by-step explanation of the development process, please refer to the PDF file: [CS589_week10_hw4_q2_19679_AdemiltonMarcelo_DaCruzNunes.pdf](path/to/your/pdf/CS589_week10_hw4_q2_19679_AdemiltonMarcelo_DaCruzNunes.pdf).

### Features
- Data preparation for semantic search
- Index embedding
- Answer generation using semantic search

## Project 2: Rerank Technology

This project demonstrates the use of Rerank technology to enhance the results of key search and semantic search. It provides examples of key search and semantic search in a Dense Retrieval setup, aiming to uncover insights into how Rerank technology improves information retrieval.

### Documentation
For a comprehensive explanation of the steps taken in this project, please refer to the PDF file: [CS589_week10_hw3_q1_19679_AdemiltonMarcelo_DaCruzNunes.pdf](path/to/your/pdf/CS589_week10_hw3_q1_19679_AdemiltonMarcelo_DaCruzNunes.pdf).

### Features
- Key search implementation
- Semantic search in Dense Retrieval
- Rerank technology for improved search results
